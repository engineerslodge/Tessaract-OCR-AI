## Introduction

Tesseract OCR AI integrates the robust Tesseract OCR engine with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to deliver superior text recognition capabilities. Whether you're dealing with complex layouts, varied fonts, or noisy images, our enhanced OCR solution aims to provide high-accuracy text extraction.

## How It Works

1. **Image Processing**: The system processes input images and prepares them for text extraction.
2. **Text Extraction**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to analyze the image and extract text.
3. **AI Enhancements**: Applies machine learning models to enhance text recognition, improve accuracy, and handle complex layouts and varied fonts.
4. **Output**: Provides the extracted text in a structured format for easy integration with other applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tesseract OCR AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tesseract-ocr-ai.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
