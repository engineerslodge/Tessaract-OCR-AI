# Tesseract OCR AI

Welcome to **Tesseract OCR AI**! This project provides an advanced optical character recognition (OCR) solution utilizing the Tesseract OCR engine enhanced with AI features for improved text extraction accuracy.

## How It Works

**Tesseract OCR AI** combines the power of the Tesseract OCR engine with advanced machine learning techniques to deliver superior text recognition capabilities. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Image Processing**: The system processes input images and prepares them for text extraction.
2. **Text Extraction**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to analyze the image and extract text.
3. **AI Enhancements**: Applies machine learning models to enhance text recognition, improve accuracy, and handle complex layouts and varied fonts.
4. **Output**: Provides the extracted text in a structured format for easy integration with other applications.
